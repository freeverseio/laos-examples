  This script mints all assets described in the ALL_ASSETS_FILE in batches of BATCH_SIZE.
  Each batch is sent in a separate transaction, as large as possible, with a delay of
  SECONDS_BETWEEN_SUBMISSIONS between sends to reduce the risk of being blocked by public nodes.

  Transactions are sent with incremental nonces, relying on the network of LAOS nodes
  to handle their sequential ordering and inclusion in the blockchain.

  In a real-world scenario, it is recommended to carefully prepare the ALL_ASSETS_FILE
  with the specific assets you need to mint. This may include unique recipient addresses
  and customized tokenURIs tailored to your requirements.

  The asset attributes can be uploaded to IPFS either before or after the minting process.
  However, uploading them beforehand is the recommended approach.
