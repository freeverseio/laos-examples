# BUIDL at ETHDenver with [**LAOS Network**](https://laosnetwork.io) 

## Mint limitless assets on Ethereum, without paying ETH

LAOS is a Layer 1 that connects without bridges to Ethereum, Polygon, their respective L2s, and any other EVM-compatible chains. It allows for the minting of large number of assets on these chains without incurring native gas fees, eliminating the need for bridges or wrapped currency, while still being fully compatible with their DApps and marketplaces.

## Why should I BUIDL with LAOS?

You can build applications on Ethereum or Polygon which require truly massive minting: mints won't require using ETH/MATIC, and you won't collapse those networks.

## No ETH for minting in Ethereum? That sounds like magic and/or a scam. How does it work? Does it use bridges?

LAOS is a parachain in the Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem, and is secured by Polkadot’s well-regarded and battle-tested security.

We use a pattern we refer to as Bridgeless Minting / Bridgeless Connectivity, which leverages Polkadot’s ‘Universal Location’ (from the XCMv3), originally developed to allow communication across its Parachains. 

LAOS' extension of this pattern links an ERC721 contract deployed on Ethereum with a sibling collection deployed in LAOS. Universal Location fills the link between both consensus systems, allowing minting and evolution to be performed in LAOS, while trading and anything related to ownership remains on Ethereum, compatible with all its ecosystem. 

No bridges are required.

## I don’t believe you. Show me the proof.

Here are the Opensea links to the [Ethereum](https://opensea.io/collection/eth-laos-bridgeless-minting) and [Polygon](https://opensea.io/collection/universal-polygon-collection) public collections of assets minted via LAOS' bridgeless pattern. No ETH or MATIC were used to mint these assets.


## Ideas for buidling DApps on LAOS Network

## How can I try this out as a user?

This is a user facing basic [on-boarding front-end](https://apps.klaos.io/). Within it, you'll find the:

- [Faucet](https://apps.klaos.io/faucet): Grab some test tokens from the Faucet;

- [Bridgeless Minter App](https://apps.klaos.io/): No-code minting of assets on Ethereum and Polygon, without paying ETH or MATIC;

- [Asset Metadata Extension](https://apps.klaos.io/extend): Permissionlesly extend the metadata of any asset.

## How can I develop on LAOS?

LAOS is fully decentralized, permissionless and open-source. The following references may help you build your DApps:

- [Documentation](https://docs.laosnetwork.io/): Full documentation, more geared towards experienced blockchain developers.

- [Examples page](https://github.com/freeverseio/laos-examples): This repot is the best place to try bridgeless minting on LAOS using standard web3 libraries, with a full set of examples in Node.JS.

- [LAOS Github](https://github.com/freeverseio/laos): The main repository for the protocol, the node, instructions on how to run it, and public RPC endpoints.

# Disclaimer

LAOS is targeting late early Q2'2024 to bid for a Parachain slot on Polkadot. 
Presently, LAOS is accessible both via its canary Parachain in Kusama, named K-LAOS, which stands for Kusama LAOS.
Please read the [disclaimer about K-LAOS](https://www.laosfoundation.io/disclaimer-klaos) that stresses the fact
that K-LAOS is used purely as a testing network.
